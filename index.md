# Brickworks

Brickworks is a group of engineers who are passionate about aerospace. The
group formed in November 2018 as an outlet for alumni members of the
student-faculty research group RIT Space Exploration (SPEX) to continue
doing space-related engineering projects.

Brickworks's mission is to do novel things with accesible hardware, share
the knowledge gained along the way, and set an example of excellence for
similar hobby projects.

## Nucleus

[Nucleus](https://brickworks.github.io/Nucleus/) is a high altitude
balloon technology demonstration mission. The key objectives of this
mission are to develop a robust avionics architecture, experiment
with core technologies which enable long duration flights, broadcast
telemetry to a remote ground terminal, and optionally collect high 
quality images from high altitudes. As a technology demonstrator,
Nucleus flight systems are designed  with the intent to be improved
or expanded upon in future missions.

## HAB-toolbox
The [HAB Toolbox](https://brickworks.github.io/HAB-toolbox) is a collection
of development tools, models, and experiments used to support our efforts
to design, build, and test high altitude balloons.
